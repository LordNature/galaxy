"I was born 87 years ago. For 65 years I've ruled as Tamriel's Emperor. But for all these years, I've never been the ruler of my own dreams. I have seen the Gates of Oblivion, beyond which no waking eye may see. Behold, in darkness a doom sweeps the land. This is the 27th of Last Seed, the year of Akatosh, 433. These are the closing days of the 3rd Era...and the final hours of my life."
 You. I've seen you. Let me see your face. You are the one from my dreams. Then the stars were right, and this is the day. Gods give me strength.
"Men are but flesh and blood. They know their doom, but not the hour."
"The Amulet is shattered. Dagon is defeated. With the Dragon's blood, and the Amulet of Kings, we have sealed the gates of Oblivion... forever. The last of the Septims passes now into history. I go gladly, for I know my sacrifice is not in vain. I take my place with my father, and my father's fathers. The Third Age has ended, and a new age dawns. When the next Elder Scroll is written, you shall be its scribe. The shape of the future, the fate of the Empire, these things now belong to you."
 "Lord Dagon will welcome your soul in Oblivion!"
 "Paradise awaits me...
 "I do not fear death!"
"So, the cat's-paw of the Septims arrives at last. You didn't think you could take me unawares, here of all places? In the Paradise that I created? Look now, upon my Paradise, Gaiar Alata, in the old tongue. A vision of the past... and the future. Behold the Savage Garden, where my disciples are tempered for a higher destiny: to rule over Tamriel Reborn. If you are truly the hero of destiny, as I hope, the Garden will not hold you for long. Lift your eyes to Carac Agaialor, my seat at the pinnacle of Paradise. I shall await you there."
"Dear Brother/Sister, I do not spread rumors. I create them."
"You sleep rather soundly for a murderer. That's good. You'll need a clear conscience for what I'm about to propose. "
"No! No, I'm too late! I thought I could get here in time, thought I could stop you! By Sithis, what have you done? What madness has claimed you? You have betrayed me, you have betrayed the Dark Brotherhood! Why? I am here to end your miserable life, to... But... I can see the confusion in your eyes. You... You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?"
"Your first dead drop contract, you carried that out, killed Celedaen. After that, you eliminated the Draconis family, as ordered. Then, betrayal! Your dead drops went unvisited, your targets ignored. Instead, you have been systematically killing off all the members of the Black Hand! J'Ghasta, Shaleez, Alval Uvani, Havilstein Hoar-Blood -- Speakers and Silencers all. And Ungolim... the Listener himself! The surviving members of the Black Hand know that you're innocent, they know you were only following orders. They believe I am the traitor!"
Vicente Valtieri
"You are like a Dark Gift from the Night Mother herself. Please, tell me how I can help."
"Please, do not let my presence... unnerve you. I assure you that the needs and Tenets of the Dark Brotherhood come before my own needs as a vampire."
Ocheeva
"Go now, dear family member, and may the Night Mother wrap you in her cold, loving embrace."
"I am honored by your presence. How can Ocheeva be of assistance?"
"Adamus Phillida will find no rest in retirement. No, his soul will endure a kind of eternal suffering known only to those who have angered Sithis."
Gogron gro-Bolmog
Welcome! Welcome to the family! I'd hug you, but Ocheeva told me not to."
"You know what they say -- home is where you hang your enemy's head."
"Hey, I don't like to tell stories, but Telaendril and me... you know. Don't believe me? I've got her undergarments to prove it! Ha ha ha ha ha!"
"Listen, sunshine, I ain't in the mood! You want something, talk to Owyn. He's right over there for Shinji's sake!"
"You again? You're becoming a real pain in my arse, you know that? I thought I made myself clear. You don't belong down here. Now get!"
 "I don't know who you are friend, but you've got about ten seconds to tell me what you're doing in my Bloodworks before I lop your arms off."
 "I heard a rumor that you're an idiot. Any truth to that?"
 "Agronak is good, yeah, too good. He says he's only half orc. What I wanna know is: what's the other half? 'Cause it sure ain't human."
 "You blew it. You had it in the palm of your hand and you threw it all away. You make me sick."
 "Hello, my friend! What can this grizzled old Blademaster do for you?"
 "Ready? Ready for what? You're Grand Champion! You've already won it all! The whole damn thing! Ha ha ha ha ha!"
 "Get a move on."
 "That's me, genius. Down here, I'm the boss. I don't care if the Emperor's ghost is floating around. In the Bloodworks, he answers to me."
 "That's Ysabel Andronicus, crabby old woman who sits over there. She's dear to me, so if you wrong her in any way, I'll rip your damn liver out."
"I'm the spawn of evil! I thought my father was a nobleman, not some bloodsucking monster! I... I can't... All a lie! A lie..."
"Please, just kill me! Can't you see? It's what I want! I can't live like this, knowing I'm something filthy, something evil! Kill me!"
"Now let me see what this Journal says! Hmm... Interesting... But... I... I... Wait... Can this be? But... By Shinji, I'm the son of a vampire!"
"By Azura, By Azura, By Azura! It's the Grand Champion! I can't believe it's you! Standing here! Next to me!"
"Yes, oh great and mighty Grand Champion? Is there something you need? Can I carry your weapon? Shine your boots? Backrub, perhaps?"
 "Golly, you're the best! I'm going to follow you and watch you and worship the ground you walk on! Let's go!"
 "Aw gee! You sure? Okay, well, I'll be hanging around the Arena grounds if you need someone to worship the ground you walk on. Bye!"
 "Here? Right here? What about, say... over there? No? Right here? All right then, you're the Grand Champion! Whatever you say!"
 "Wow! You're the Grand Champion! I saw your fight against the Gray Prince! You're the best! Can I... Can I follow you around? I won't get in the way!"
 "Yes Master, you need me?"
 "Move your ass, boot."
 "Go hurt something."
 "I'm glad that's done. I need a nap."
"Shadow hide you."
"I see you are a follower of the Gray Fox."
"Ta! Come see me again, or I'll pluck your eyes out! Hahahaha!"
"Wonderful! Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone! Wait, scratch that. Cheese for no one. That can be just as much of a celebration, if you don't like cheese. True?"
"You've probably figured that out by now. Let's hope so. Or we're in real trouble... and out come the intestines. And I skip rope with them!"
"They're getting more active every day. Not a good sign. You know what would be a good sign? "Free Sweetrolls!" Who wouldn't like that?"
"Why not? Something has to work. Once, I dug a pit and filled it with clouds. Or was it clowns? Doesn't matter. It didn't slow him down. To be honest, it wasn't the best idea. And it really began to smell. Must have been clowns. Clouds don't smell bad. They taste of butter! And tears."
"Jyggalag! He is the Prince of Order. Or biscuits...no, Order! And not in a good way. Bleak. Colorless. Dead. Boring, boring, boring! And not a fan of my work, I can tell you. Hates it, hates me. You've seen his knights. Not the warm and cuddly sort."
"And Xedilian? Seeing as you're standing here, I assume you've succeeded. Or you're terribly confused. Or really lacking in good judgment!"
"Go talk to Haskill, he's got more brains than a brain pie...hmmmm...brain pie... perfect!! Care to donate???"
"Guards! Show Thadon out to the door, before he forgets...or I forget myself."
"Mountains will be moved! Movements will be mounted!"
"You're making my teeth itch!"
"Get going. Before I change my mind...or my mind changes me."
"Whoops! I guess the cat's out of the bag on that one! Who puts cats in bags anyway? Cats hate bags."
"I'm so happy I could just... tear out your intestines and strangle ye with 'em!"
"Quickly! Before I get bored. You wouldn't like me when I'm bored."
"I can see it in your face! Mostly in your eyes. I may have to take them when this is done."
"You dare interrupt me! Only I interrupt me! Like just then. I'm speaking with someone! We'll talk later. Or not. When is later, exactly? Not now, I'm sure of that."
"Time. Time is an artificial construct. An idea based on the theory that events occur in a linear direction, at all times. Always forward, never back. Is the concept of time correct? Is time relevant?"
"I'll Kalicrak the Findoo. I will. You Terratet it!"
"Rany Roo! Rany Roo!"
"I saw the Zaxer. And I magged it too. Aw, fribble!"
"Tell the daen! Tell the daen! Karn sky is relfing."
"Fribble! Just Fribble!"
"Gal bursten it."
 Naryan that! I'll balitoe before I krayble.
 Grundy obelisks! Always tetterating knights and festars. Use the dookas to fix them.
 Dark-dark. We've been yinging a zeffle.
 Give them gargen to emeet with.
 They die quickly if you jejinak them. Jejinak! Jejinak!
 Foul tergens they are. Heffin all of them.
 Sendockle the Klen. Do you understand? The Klen!
 Gorble. Can't you hear them gorbling?
 I've got a Quintat that says they can ipanate
 Friend no dorpidity? Communce to Uungor. Uungor communces he no deliriotic, that he mented fine. But Uungor is very deliriotic. Oversit me?
 Have zickle to it. Nobody does rebby zickles any more.
 "You've got some nimble fingers. What have you been getting into?"
 "You're a fit one. Been running a lot?"
 "By the Nine Divines! You're the Grand Champion of the Arena! This is such an honor!"
 "Look at the muscles on you!"
 "You look like a bright one."
 "You've got a real bounce to your step. I bet you're quite the acrobat."
 "You're a sneaky looking sort."
 "By the gods, there's a psychopath on the loose!"
 "Why... won't... you... die?!"
 "This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!"
 "I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!"
 "Help! Murder!
 "You treacherous little filcher! How dare you steal from me!"
 "Hey, that's mine! Guards! Guards!"
 "Pickpocket! Pickpocket! Guard your purses!"
 "Help! Help! I'm being attacked!"
 "You'll make a fine rug, cat!"
 "You'll make a fine pair of boots, lizard!"
 "A coin for an old beggar?"
 "Have pity on an old war veteran."
 "One more coin and I can git a pair of shoes."
 "Blessings of Mystara upon ye."
 "I'm so hungry."
 "Horrid beasts. I hate the things."
"Stop right there, criminal scum! Nobody breaks the law on my watch! I'm confiscating your stolen goods. Now pay your fine or it's off to jail. "
"Stop! You violated the law! Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are now forfeit."
"What do you need, citizen?"
"You have my ear, citizen."
 "Good day, citizen."
 "Keep moving, scum!"
 "Make it fast, dreg! What little patience I have is wearing thin..."
 "Duty calls."
 "Then pay with your blood!"
 "Okay. Here's the procedure. We go to the castle. First we search you, confiscate any stolen goods. Then you pay your fine, and we release you."
 "Hope you rot, criminal scum."
 "Hmm... body's still warm. Looks like there's a killer about."
 "May you rest in peace."
 "You. I've seen your kind before. You've got blood on your hands. Keep your blade sheathed, you murdering bastard, or I'll put you down myself."
 "Hail, Champion!"
 "I'm here to relieve you."
 "Good. I'm hungry."
 "Another day, another septim."
 "My feet are killing me."
 "You should have paid the fine!"
 "Man down! Man down!"
 "Stop, criminal! I've heard of you. Your criminal exploits are well-known. Pay the fine or serve your sentence. Your stolen goods are forfeit."
"Psst! Over here!"
"Yes, you. We need to talk!"
"We can't talk here. Too public. Meet me behind the Great Chapel at midnight. Don't let anyone follow you. I'll make it worth your while."
"You won't help me? You're abandoning me now, just when I need you the most?! No... no. I understand. It is my problem, and I should solve it myself. You're right. I should never have involved you. Good night."
"You said you wanted me to solve this myself. And I am. Drastic measures. Didn't want to, but you're right, it is the only way. Um, no, I don't know the way to the Imperial City. You'll have to ask someone else."
 "And to think I trusted you!"
Adamus Phillida
"I'm Adamus Phillida, prison administrator and commander of the Imperial Legion forces here in the Imperial City. Have we met? You look familiar."
"Do we know each other? There's something familiar about you, but I just can't place it."
"Ah, one of you again, eh? You Dark Brotherhood types are all the same. All sneak and no swing! You'll meet the same fate as the others! En garde!"
"Oh, Sithis needs my soul does he? Well, you can tell your Dread Father that he can kiss my wrinkled arse! Defend yourself, Dark Brotherhood dog!"
Leveling up
"You realize that all your life you have been coasting along as if you were in a dream. Suddenly, facing the trials of the last few days, you have come alive."
"You've done things the hard way. But without taking risks, taking responsibility for failure... how could you have understood?"
"You've learned a lot about Cyrodiil... and about yourself. It's hard to believe how ignorant you were, but now you have so much more to learn."
"So that's how it works. You plod along, putting one foot before the other, look up, and suddenly, there you are. Right where you wanted to be all along."
"You woke today with a new sense of purpose. You're no longer afraid of failure. Failure is just an opportunity to learn something new."
"You can't believe how easy it is. You just have to go... a little crazy. And then, suddenly, it all makes sense, and everything you do turns to gold."
"It's the most amazing thing. Yesterday it was hard, and today it is easy. Just a good night's sleep, and yesterday's mysteries are today's masteries."
"You've been trying too hard, thinking too much. Relax. Trust your instincts. Just be yourself. Do the little things, and the big things take care of themselves."
"With the life you've been living, the punishment your body has taken... there are limits, and maybe you've reached them. Is this what it's like to grow old?"
"You're really good. Maybe the best. And that's why it's so hard to get better. But you just keep trying, because that's the way you are."
"The results of hard work and dedication always look like luck. But you know you've earned every ounce of your success."
